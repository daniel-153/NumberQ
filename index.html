          This page discusses the technical information about how NumberQ works.
          The following will mainly focus on the important math concepts
          underlying the generators and the techniques used to implement those
          math concepts. This information is not needed to use the site, but is
          provided for anyone who may be interested.

        <h2 class="section-head">Objectives For Problem Generation:</h2>
        <p class="section-desc">
          NumberQ's math problem generation is aimed at solving common
          shortcommings invovled with creating random math questions. One issue
          with math problem generators is that they often produce problems of a
          very predictable structure. A linear equation generator, for instance,
          could simply use the form \(ax+b=cx+d\), substitute random values for
          the coefficients, and calculate the solution \(x=\frac{d-b}{a-c}\).
          The problem with this approach is that it undermines student's
          learning. Instead of learning the general method for solving linear
          equations, students memorize an arbitrary set of steps because there
          is no variation in structure.
          <br /><br />
          Another issue faced by math problem generators is the difficultly of
          creating "clean" problems. For example, suppose random values were
          subtituted for the coefficients in \(\frac{x}{a}+b=c\). This may
          result in relatively unpredictable problems, but an issue arises with
          the chosen values of the coefficients: they may result in numbers that
          are difficult to work with. Randomly substituting coefficients could
          result in \(\frac{x}{7}-13=10\), which requires \((7\cdot 23)\) to be
          calculated in order to solve. This may not entirely undermine the
          learning process if a calculator were involved, but if the equation
          were just changed to \(\frac{x}{7}+13=10\), it would clearly be a much
          cleaner problem.
          <br /><br />
          A third issue that a math problem generator needs to overcome is the
          ability to enforce particular mathematical properties. As an example,
          a naive approach to an "order of operations" question generator would
          be to select a few random numbers and separate them by random
          operators: \(N_{1}\circ N_{2} \circ N_{3}\). However, this could yield
          \(2-5+7\), which is useless if students haven't yet been introduced to
          negative numbers. On the other hand, if students are currently
          learning how to work with negative numbers, this may be exactly the
          type of problem the teacher wants. The generator would be much more
          useful if it allowed teachers to select for properties like this.
          <br /><br />
          This is just a brief summary of challenges for math problem
          generation. NumberQ does not completely resolve these issues, but it
          was created to help address them. The following will explain some of
          the mathematical and programming techniques used for this. The problem
          generators are coded in JavaScript and do <i>not</i> make use of any
          form of AI or Large Language Model. At the time of writing, LLMs do
          not seem to be the optimal solution to math problem creation. They are
          too predictable, difficult to prompt for specific mathematical
          properties, and often produce incorrect answers.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-head">Generators For Constraints</h3>
        <p class="section-desc">
          This is a method for addressing the issue of "clean numbers" in
          randomly generated math problems. Take for instance the following
          equation and its solution:
          <span class="block-math">\(ax+b=c;~~x=\frac{c-b}{a}\)</span>
          Some specific substitutions for the coefficients may be \(9x-3=6\),
          \(3x+5=11\), \(6x+7=2\), and \(8x+2=4\) with solutions of \(1, 2,
          -\frac{5}{6},\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\) respectively. The first two
          equations are preferrable because they have simple integer solutions.
          More specifically, they have the property that \(c-b=ka\) where \(k\)
          is an integer. Solving \(c-b=ka\) for \(a\) yields
          \(a=\frac{c-b}{k}\). If the equation must have integer coefficients,
          then \(c-b\) must also be an integer multiple of \(k\), yielding
          \(c-b=jk\) (so \(a=j\)). Isolating \(c\) gives \(c=b+jk\), and since
          \(b\) must be some integer (pick \(i\)), \(c=i+jk\). Substituing these
          values for \(a, b,\) and \(c\) back into the original equation yields
          the following:
          <span class="block-math">\(ax+b=c \rightarrow [j]x+[i]=[i+jk]\)</span>
          This adjusted equaton (where each expression in brackets [] represets
          a single coefficient) now has two properties: it has both integer
          coefficients and integer solutions for all values of \(i, j, k;~~j\neq
          0\). This kind of "transformation" is particulary useful for
          programming a linear equation generator. Rather than having to
          randomly substitute and check values for \(a, b,\) and \(c\) until an
          integer solution is found, program can pick <i>any</i> values for \(i,
          j, k;~~j\neq 0\), and always meet this constraint. Furthermore, the
          solution to the transformed equation is always \(x=k\), so there is no
          need to calculate or verify the solution (it is known when the
          equation is generated). <br /><br />
          Note that this specific reordering of coefficients is not the only one
          that transforms the equation to have the desired properties. Isolating
          \(a, b,\) and \(c\) in a different order could have also yieled
          slightly different forms. All of the following transform the equation
          in this manner:
          <span class="block-math">
            \(\begin{array}{c} ax+b=c & \rightarrow & [j]x+[i]=[i+jk] \\ ax+b=c
            & \rightarrow & [j]x+[i-jk]=[i] \\ ax+b=c & \rightarrow &
            [i+j]x+[-ik]=[jk] \end{array}\)
          </span>
          This type of transformation essentially creates a "generator" to meet
          specific constraints, and it generalizes to other scenarios where the
          goal is to create algebriac math questions programmatically without
          running a random search algorithm (which is much more computationally
          expensive).
          <br /><br />
          Consider another linear equation form and one of its respective
          transformations to force integer solutions and coefficients:
          <span class="block-math">
            \(\begin{array}{l} ax+b=cx+d;~~x=\frac{d-b}{c-a} \\ x\Rightarrow
            k=\frac{d-b}{c-a}~~~\scriptstyle{\mathbf{(1)}} \\ a\Rightarrow
            l=\frac{b-d+kc}{k}~~~\scriptstyle{\mathbf{(2)}} \\ c\Rightarrow
            m=\frac{-b+d+kl}{k}~~~\scriptstyle{\mathbf{(3)}} \\ b\Rightarrow
            n=d+kl-km~~~\scriptstyle{\mathbf{(4)}} \\ d=n-kl+km \end{array}\)
          </span>
          <span class="block-math">\( \Downarrow \)</span>
          <span class="block-math">\( [l]x+[n]=[m]x+[n-kl+km]\)</span>
          In each of steps (1)&ndash;(4), a new integer was introduced to meet a
          constraint. Step (1) introduced \(k\) to represent an integer
          solution. Then, in steps (2)&ndash;(4), \(l, m,\) and \(n\) were
          introduced to ensure that all of the coefficients remain integers.
          Finally, \(d\) was determined by an expression that is an integer for
          all integer values of its coefficients. The result is an equation in
          the same form as \(ax+b=cx+d\), but where all possible integer values
          for \(k, l, m, n;~~l \neq m\) yield the integer solution \(x=k\).
          <br /><br />
          There are some important characteristics to note about the process
          above. First, the equation had 4 coefficients, and it required 4
          substitutions to transform. Second, a different order could have been
          taken to isolate the coefficients, and this would have yielded a
          different transformed form with the same properties. Additionally,
          just as the \(ax+b=c\) equation from above, one remapped coefficient
          seems to "absorb" the values of the others:
          <span class="block-math">
            \(\begin{array}{c} ax+b=c \\ \Downarrow \\ [j]x+[i]=[i+jk] \\ \\
            \hline \\ ax+b=cx+d \\ \Downarrow \\ [l]x+[n]=[m]x+[n-kl+km]
            \end{array}\)
          </span>
          The tendency for the value of one transformed coefficient to absorb
          the values of the others is the general characteristic of this
          transformation process. A the most basic level, the process is
          negating every operation that can lead to non-integer solutions in an
          algebra problem. In \(ax=b\) for example, the transformation is simply
          \([j]x=[jk]\), and the motivation for this adjustment clear without
          any computation. Furthermore, this general method of "negation" can
          also be used to meet other constraints besides "integer solutions."
          For example, it might be desired that the subtraction \( a-b \) has a
          non-negative result, and the corresponding transformation is \(
          [k+l]-[l] \). These two examples are a good representation of the
          "generators for constraints" method in general:
          <span class="block-math">
            \(\begin{array}{c} \frac{a}{b} \rightarrow \frac{[lk]}{[l]} \\ a-b
            \rightarrow [k+l]-[l] \end{array}\)
          </span>
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-head">
          Generators For Constraints (more applications):
        </h2>
        <p class="section-desc">
          An important characteristic of the general method described above is
          that it can be applied to many other topics besides linear equations. 
          That being said, the specific process used to
          transform constraints to generators in other topics is often better
          framed graphically or geometrically. In other words, different methods
          can be used to reach similar results to those obtained for the linear
          equations above.
          <br /><br />
          The pythagorean theorem \(a^2+b^2=c^2\) is one such example where
          alternative methods can be applied. This is another case where integer
          solutions are desirable but unlikely for random substitutions of the
          coefficients. Suppose the following complex number \(z\) represents a
          lattice point in the first quadrant of the cartesian plane:
          <span class="block-math"
            >\( \begin{array}{c} z=P_{x} + P_{y}i \\ (i=\sqrt{-1};~~P_{x},P_{y}
            \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}) \end{array}\)</span
          >
          An integer solution to the pythagorean theorem is represented by a
          lattice point (in Q1) that has an integer distance from the origin.
          For the complex number \(z\) (above), this occurs when \(z\) has an
          integer magnitude. This is a useful restatement of the original
          constraint. Consider the following operation:
          <span class="block-math"
            >\( \begin{array}{l}
              z'= z^2=(P_{x}+P_{y}i)^{2} \\ 
              z'= P_{x}^{2}+2P_{x}P_{y}i-P_{y}^2 \\
              z'= (P_{x}^2-P_{y}^2)+(2P_{x}P_{y})i
              \end{array}\)</span
          >
          If \(P_{x},P_{y} \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\) and \(P_{x}>P_{y}\), it follows that 
          the real and imaginary components of \(z'\) are positve integers (so \(z'\) also
          represents an integer lattice point in Q1). However, since the magnitude of a
          product of two complex numbers is equal to the product of their individual
          magnitudes \( \lvert z_{1}z_{1} \rvert = \lvert z_{1} \rvert \lvert z_{2} \rvert\), 
          the magnitude of \(z'\) is an integer:
          <span class="block-math"
            >\( \begin{array}{l}
              \lvert z' \rvert = \sqrt{(P_{x}^2-P_{y}^2)^2 + (2P_{x}P_{y})^2} \\ 
              \lvert z' \rvert = \sqrt{P_{x}^4+2P_{x}^2P_{y}^2+P_{y}^4} \\
              \lvert z' \rvert = P_{x}^2 + P_{y}^2
              \end{array}\)</span
          >
          As a result, the point represented by the compontents of \(z'\) satisfies the 
          original constraint of a lattice point in Q1 with an integer distance to the origin: 
          \( \left( P_{x}^2-P_{y}^2,~2P_{x}P_{y} \right);~~P_{x},P_{y} \in \mathbb{Z}^{+};~P_{x}>P_{y} \).
          Furthermore, it can be shown that positive integer values of \(P_{x},P_{y}\) generate
          <i>all</i> unique pythagorean triples in this manner (that is, all triples where \(\operatorname{GCF}(a,b,c)=1\)).
          Transforming the pythagorean theorem to utilize the componets of \(z'\) yields the following
          (another conversion of a constraint to a generator):
          <span class="block-math">
            \(\begin{array}{c} 
            a^2+b^2=c^2 \\
            \Downarrow \\
            [P_{x}^2-P_{y}^2]^2+[2P_{x}P_{y}]^2=[P_{x}^2 + P_{y}^2]^2
            \end{array}\)
          </span>
          Another case where geometric and graphical reasoning can be applied to create a generator for 
          constraints is a system of linear equations. In a system of equations such as the following, an integer
          solution for both \(x\) and \(y\) if often desirable:
          <span class="block-math">
            \(\begin{array}{l} 
            y=ax+b \\
            y=cx+d
            \end{array}\)
          </span>
